# Overview
This document supports the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources's Central
Sands Lakes Study Technical Report and may be included as an appendix detailing
how "Average Seasonal Lake Levels" are defined. In addition to this write-up, a
separate write-up will be required to describe how the historical lake levels
were reconstructed (detailing both the main approach plus additional lines of
evidence, such as tree core analysis and historical air photos).

<br> 

# Background

## Natural Hydrologic Regimes
Emphasize that dynamic variation is critical to “natural”, “typical”, or
“average” hydrologic conditions. Introduce Poff et al. components of natural
regime for streams (magnitude, frequency, duration, timing/predictability,
flashiness).

## Lake Level Frequency Curves
Introduce the idea of frequency curves (broken up by season) as a way to define
the “average seasonal water level” for lakes and capture most of Poff elements
(with the assumption that “flashiness” is not as critical for lakes as it is for
streams). Decision to focus on 50%, 10%, and 90% exceedance levels.

## Window of Analysis
Note that there is no “undisturbed” state in the Central Sands within the period
of record, so our selection of which years to use should be based entirely upon
the math/logistical consideration, not specifics related to the Central Sands
land use, etc. Mention need to compare apples to apples with modeling
simulations, thus not only limited by availability of historical lake level data
but also availability of model outputs.

<br> 

# Approach
All calculations involved in the analysis of average seasonal lake levels were
performed using R 3.5.0 and are contained in the R package “CSLSlevels”. Data
and code are available at [https://github.com/cvoter/CSLSlevels].

## Lake Level Frequency Curves
To calculate seasonal lake level frequency curves for each lake, we divided the
timeseries of reconstructed monthly lake levels (see Bob’s section) into four
separate timeseries for spring, summer, fall, and winter lake levels. We defined
spring as the months of March, April, and May; summer as June, July, and August;
fall as September, October, and November; and winter as December, January, and
February. We then arranged lake level observations in each seasonal timeseries
from highest (rank = 1) to lowest and calculated the exceedance probability ,
$p_{i}$ (%), of each observation as follows:

\begin{align}
\tag{1}
p_{i} = 100*\frac{i}{n + 1}
\end{align}

where $i$ is the rank of the observation and $n$ is the total number of
observations.

<br>

From these seasonal lake level frequency curves, we used linear interpolation to
extract the lake levels associated with a 10%, 50%, and 90% exceedance
probability.

<br>

## Sensitivity to Window of Analysis
While the reconstructed timeseries of monthly lake levels dates back to 1905,
the MODFLOW model associated with this project is only able to simulate lake
levels since 1981 due to the availability of daily, spatially-gridded
precipitation and air temperature data for model inputs. In order to fairly
compare observed and simulated lake level exceedance curves, we opted to
calculate observed lake level exceedance curves for the same period as the
MODFLOW model: 1981-2018.

<br>

To evaluate the effect of using a shorter timeseries (e.g., 1981-2018) for lake
level exceedance curves rather than a longer timeseries (e.g., 1905-2018), we
performed a sensitivity analysis on how the number of years used to generate the
lake level exceedance curves affects the lake levels associated with the 10%,
50%, and 90% exceedance probabilities. We randomly sampled lake levels from an
increasing number of years and calculated the lake levels associated with the
10%, 50%, and 90% exceedance probabilities for each random permutation. We did
this 50 times for each possible window length (from 1 year up to 115 years).
Results show that incorporating more years of data into the lake level
exceedance curve reduces variation in estimates of the lake levels associated
with the 10%, 50%, and 90% exceedance probabilities (Figure 1). However, there
is an inflection point at a window size of about 30 years, which indicates that
by using at least 30 years of data, we should reasonably converge on long-term
behavior.

## Pleasant Lake
Average seasonal lake levels at Pleasant Lake are the least dynamic of the three
lakes in this study (Figure 2). The seasonal lake level exceedance curves show
that lake levels have historically fluctuated between 297.8 mamsl and 299.9
mamsl, a 2.1 m range.  However, lake levels rarely reach the extremes of this
range. The lake levels associated with the 10% and 90% exceedance probabilities
are within 0.6 m to 0.7 m of one another in all four seasons (Table 1). As the
deepest point of the lake is 291.1 mamsl, this correspsonds to a typical lake
depth of 7 m to 7.9 m. Lake levels are generally lowest in the spring and
highest in the fall.

<br>

This stability in average seasonal lake levels is also evident in the minimal
variation in lakeshores associated with the 10%, 50%, and 90% exceedance
probabilities for each season (Figure 3).  Much of the lakeshore experiences
minimal change across these lake levels, however the connectivity between Turtle
Bay (in the southwest corner of the lake) and the larger lake is sensitive to
this variation in lake levels; Turtle Bay occasionally becomes connected to the
larger lake in the summer and the fall. The penisula of land in the northeast
corner of the lake is also more sensitive than the rest of the lakeshore to
variations in lake levels, becoming more prominent at lower lake levels.

```{r psnt, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 3.5, fig.align="center"}
lake      <- "Pleasant"
lake_name <- sprintf("%s Lake", lake)
plot_seasonal_curves(ranked_annual, ranked_seasons, lake_name)
```

```{r psnt02, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 4, fig.align="center"}
new_levels       <- ranked_levels %>%
                    filter(lake == sprintf("%s Lake", !!lake)) %>%
                    select(season, prob, level) %>%
                    dcast(season~prob)
new_levels[,2:4] <- round(new_levels[,2:4], 2)
kable(new_levels)
```

```{r psnt03, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 6.5, fig.align="center"}
plot_lake_areas(lake, ranked_levels)
```

## Long Lake

The seasonal lake level exceedance curves for Long Lake (Figure 4) show that
lake levels have historically fluctuated between 333.1 mamsl and 336.3 mamsl, a
3.2 m range. Importantly, the deepest point of the lake is at 332.9 mamsl, which
indicates that the lake is occasionally as shallow as 20 cm. Based on the 10%
and 90% exceedance probabilities, the lake is more commonly between 333.6 mamsl
and 334.5 mamsl, or between 70 cm and 2.1 m deep (Table 2). Lake levels are
generally lowest in the spring and highest in the fall.

<br>

While the typical range in lake levels at Long Lake is similar to the typical
range in lake levels at Pleasant Lake (0.9 m), it corresponds with more visible
differences in the lakeshore at the shallower Long Lake (Figure 5). The
lakeshores associated with 10% and 50% exceedance probabilities at Long Lake are
similar to one another, but the lakeshores associated with 90% exceedance
probabilities are much more sensitive to lake levels due to the flat lake bed at
these elevations.

```{r long, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 3.5, fig.align="center"}
lake      <- "Long"
lake_name <- sprintf("%s Lake", lake)

```

```{r long02, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 4, fig.align="center"}
new_levels       <- ranked_levels %>%
                    filter(lake == sprintf("%s Lake", !!lake)) %>%
                    select(season, prob, level) %>%
                    dcast(season~prob)
new_levels[,2:4] <- round(new_levels[,2:4], 2)
kable(new_levels)
```

```{r long03, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 6.5, fig.align="center"}
plot_lake_areas(lake, ranked_levels)
```

## Plainfield Lake

The seasonal lake level exceedance curves for Plainfield Lake (Figure 6) show
that lake levels have historically fluctuated between 333.1 mamsl and 335.8
mamsl, a 2.7 m range. The deepest point of Plainfield Lake is at 332.1 mamsl,
which indicates that the lake is occasionally as shallow as 1.0 m and as deep as
3.7 m. Plainfield Lake reaches these extremes more commonly than Pleasant Lake
or Long Lake reach their extremes. Based on the 10% and 90% exceedance
probabilities, the lake is often (80% of the time) between 333.5 mamsl and 334.7
mamsl, or between 1.4 m and 2.6 m deep (Table 3). As in both Pleasant Lake and
Long Lake, lake levels at Plainfield Lake are generally lowest in the spring and
highest in the fall.

```{r pfl, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 3.5, fig.align="center"}
lake      <- "Plainfield"
lake_name <- sprintf("%s Lake", lake)
plot_seasonal_curves(ranked_annual, ranked_seasons, lake_name)
```

```{r pfl02, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 4, fig.align="center"}
new_levels       <- ranked_levels %>%
                    filter(lake == sprintf("%s Lake", !!lake)) %>%
                    select(season, prob, level) %>%
                    dcast(season~prob)
new_levels[,2:4] <- round(new_levels[,2:4], 2)
kable(new_levels)
```

<br>

Out of all three lakes in this study, the lakeshore at Plainfield Lake is the
most sensitive to lake level variation (Figure 7). At infrequent low levels,
particularly in the spring, islands can appear throughout the lake. The
lakeshore at the southeast corner of the lake is especially dynamic, with a
peninsula of land that occasionally becomes an island during infrequent high
lake levels in the summer, fall, and winter.
